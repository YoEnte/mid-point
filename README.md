# mid-point
Implementing mid point algorithm in as many languages as possible.

The mid point algorithm is a quite simple one for generating a pixelated circle.
I randomly stumbled upon it and wanted to implement it just for fun, but thought by myself that I could add implementations in other languages over time.

This project acts as a small challenge for me and I progress on it, when I got enough time.

## current language support:
